# Project 1 - The Gifd of Food

## Description 
The Gifd of Food is a web application that allows a user to search for a recipe. They will be prompted to choose a recipe from the dropdown of suggested recipe names that match their search. Once selected, they will be navigated to the recipe page for their choice. 

One of the biggest challenges we faced in the frontend, was utilizing the grid on UI Kit for our "meet the team" page. From the perspective of the backend, it was toughest pulling the ingredients list from the Meal DB API. The name of the ingredients were accessed in different places than the measurements, so we needed to consolidate multiple lines of information into concise one line ingredient steps.





opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## A couple of things our team learned:
* Using git status often is very important to know what you are choosing to stage for commit
* We learned how to create GitHub branches and Pull Requests
* Media queries.
* Utilized a new CSS Framework (UIkit) besides Bootstrap.
* When running into merge conflicts, we synced as a group to address them one by one so that the conflicts would not escalate.
* Pulling from develop consistently was important.
